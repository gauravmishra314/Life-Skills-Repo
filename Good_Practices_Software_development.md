## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?
Answer 1: Some points that were new to me:
* Writing down all questions and sending them as a single message to avoid bombarding teammates with multiple messages.
* Using tools like Codepen or Codesandbox to share code setups and help explain problems better.
* Keeping the video on during meetings to improve rapport with the team.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
Answer 2: I think I need to improve in the area of staying focused during work. I often get distracted by notifications and social media. To make progress:
I'll start by putting my phone on silent during work hours and keeping notifications off for non-work apps.
I'll use a time-tracking app like Boosted to monitor how much time I spend working vs. being distracted.
I’ll also try to block social media sites using tools like Freedom while I’m working.
This way, I can give my full attention to tasks and finish them faster!
